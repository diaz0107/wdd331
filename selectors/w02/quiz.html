/* 1.  The second <p> of the second <fieldset> could be selected by either of these selectors below. Explain why the first would be a better option than the second.
    
    fieldset[title=fieldset2] > p + p

    fieldset:nth-of-type(2) > p + p

    The first selector is better because despite them having the same specifity score, it more specifically describes the target elements: the paragraph children of the fieldset titled 'fieldset2' as opposed those of the second fieldset, which may change in the markup document.


2.  Explain the difference the space makes with the following two selectors: "span.help" and "span .help". How does it change what will be selected?

    The difference between 'span.help' and 'span .help' is that 'span.help' targets all HTML <span> elements with a class of 'help', and 'span .help' targets all the descendants of <span> elements with the 'help' class. That one space between selectors changes the style target from one element to its descendants. Spacing in CSS selectors matters. 


3.  For the example HTML download, write the CSS that would surround the help text (class=“help”) with parenthesis.
 */
    .help::before {
        content: '(';
    }

    .help::after {
        content: ')';
    }

4.  Short forms are always nice. Write a CSS rule that will hide any paragraphs in a fieldset after the 2nd.

    fieldset:nth-of-type(n+3) p {
        display: none;
