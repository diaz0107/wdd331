        <p>
          One of the coolest things about learning html and css is that the
          world quite literally is our textbook...at least the world-wide-web is
          our textbook :). HTML is an open standard, and in order for the
          browser to interprete the page it has to download it all into
          itself...so you have all the source code for every page that you
          visit!
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the habits that I hope you will develop is to dig into that
          code when you see something cool that someone else has done on their
          site. It's a great way to learn new things.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          Just for review. The best way to look 'under the hood' is to right
          click on an element on the page and select 'Inspect'. There are
          keyboard shortcuts as well. They change slightly based on browser and
          operating sytem. On a Mac in Safari or Chrome for example you would
          hit cmd-alt-i to open the inspector. On Windows this would be
          ctrl-shift-i. If you have not spent much time here...spend some now to
          familiarize yourself...this is a powerful tool for troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <h2>The open web</h2>
        <p>
          The fact that anyone can not only see, but copy and re-use anyone
          elses html and css has caused the web to become a pretty open place.
          Because many web designers/developers learned much of what they know
          by looking at others work, they tend to be pretty cool with you doing
          the same with theirs. There are limits however. Looking at code and
          learning a technique that you will use in a page of your own is one
          thing...copy/pasting code directly from someone else and calling it
          your own is quite another.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          This doesn't mean that you can never copy/paste code from someone
          else. There are many helpful folks on the web that solve particular
          problems and then share the solutions intending them to be used. The
          key is to practice what you learned over all those years of taking
          English classes and learning to write. Give credit where credit is
          due...cite your sources. You will often see this done with a comment
          by the snippet of code you have borrowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Solving problems</h2>
        <p>
          Turns out many web designers/developers are chronic problem solvers.
          When they are particularly proud of the creativeness or elegance of a
          solution they like to share it. Many sites have popped up on the web
          to allow this to happen. We are going to use one of them this semester
          in this class called
          <a href="http://codepen.io" target="_blank">codepen.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this activity we are going to take advantage of this open sharing
          nature of the web to learn more about selectors than we now know by
          learning to review others code.
        </p>
        <h2>Activity Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 1:</span> Go to
          <a href="http://codepen.io" target="_blank">codepen.io</a> and browse
          for a while. Look at several pens and become familiar with the layout
          and how it presents the html, css, and javascript that was used for
          the pen. Choose 2 pens that include css selectors that either you
          don't understand, have never used before, or would not have thought to
          use in the way the author did to review further. (This could involve
          creative uses of combinators, attribute selectors, pseudo classes or
          elements, or specificity)
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          While looking you will notice many of the pens using javascript as
          well as css to solve the problem the author concerned with. I would
          avoid those for now. Also if the middle CSS window says SASS, SCSS, or
          Stylus next to the CSS make sure you hit the 'View Compiled' button
          (Hit the down arrow button at the top right of the CSS section). That
          will turn the SASS into plain ol' CSS that you will have an easier
          time understanding. This also applies to the html pane. If it doesn't
          look like html hit that 'View Compiled' button as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 2:</span> Dig into those selectors and
          figure out what they are doing and why they chose to do it in that
          way...we are looking to gain understanding of their code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 3:</span> Post the URLs to your 2
          examples to a Selectors discussion (in Slack or Teams) along with an explanation of what
          you learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 4:</span> Review at least 2 other posts
          and post your thoughts on what they learned as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Completion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two examples posted in class discussion.</li>
          <li>Good explanations given for both examples.</li>
          <li>Two other posts responded to.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>
            Looking at the css for this pen:
            <a href="http://codepen.io/brownerd/pen/zvyQYL" target="_blank"
              >Love for Paris</a
            >
            I ran across this :
          </p>
          <code></code>
            <pre>
[class*=stage] {
  border: 10px solid #333;
  border-top: none;
  border-left: none;
  border-right: none;
  height: 20px;
  position: absolute;
}</pre
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            I also noticed that there are 2 similarly named classes in 2 divs in
            the HTML: stage-1 and stage-2. The css uses the attribute selector
            to grab all the elements with a class attribute whose value is
            <em>like</em> "stage". So they could grab both elements with one
            selector to set some default styles. Very efficient.
